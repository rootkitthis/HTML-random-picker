[Live Demo](https://frontendrandompicker.netlify.app)

This is a fun project that I created originally as a CLI Python script that I wanted to challenge myself and build it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

The goal is to take comma separated input from user in a text box and then randomly choose one of the items from the list.
