# Description

##### *Note: This is still a work in progress but got the bones and basic logic working.*

This is a fun project that I created originally as a CLI Python script that I wanted to challenge myself and build it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The goal is to take comma separated input from user in a text box and then randomly choose one of the items from the list.
